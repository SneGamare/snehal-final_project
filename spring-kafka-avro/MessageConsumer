 * Interface for a generic message consumer.

 * <p>
 * This interface defines the contract for a message consumer that processes Kafka records with key
 * of type {@code String} and value of generic type {@code T}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Methods: - {@code process}: This method is responsible for processing a Kafka record encapsulated
 * in a {@link ReceiverRecord}. Implementations should define the logic for handling the events.
 *
 * @param <T> The generic type representing the value type of Kafka records.
 *            <p>
 *            Usage: - Implement this interface in classes that will handle the processing of Kafka
 *            records. - The `process` method is invoked by the Kafka consumer to handle each
 *            received message.
 * @see ReceiverRecord
